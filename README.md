# PSO-TSP-Solver
This project implements a non-deterministic solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. The solution leverages MPI and the MASS library to parallelize computations and achieve significant performance improvements.

#Overview
The Travelling Salesman Problem is an NP-hard optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting point. This implementation adapts PSO principles to encode routes as particles and iteratively optimize them to find the best solution.
